# DD-RDF

This is a collection of packages that were copied from the original source to make sure they stay available. `rdf2go` is the main one used in other services, the rest are dependencies of `rdf2go`. Perhaps these will be streamlined into one library later.

Original repositories:

* https://github.com/kiivihal/rdf2go
* https://github.com/deiu/gon3
* https://github.com/rychipman/easylex
* https://github.com/kiivihal/gojsonld

Note that some tests already failed before forking.
